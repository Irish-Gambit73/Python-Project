Welcome TO my To-Do list! 

Necessary: 
- Visit Calgary :)))
- Make animations: Idle, attack, walk https://github.com/fireclawthefox/panda3d-tutorial/blob/master/Panda3D%20Tutorial.pdf
- Gui and menu (Menu.py and healthbars)
- Create an arena (Castlevenia)
- Collisions and loaders for traps, fire, lava       need to get lava for arena
- Install YABEE and blender 2.7 for converting .glb files into .egg files. Need this for collisions

Necessary Little: 
- Fix Ai's z movement (why does it still want to go on z axis)
- Fix Lighting (shadowcasting why is everything black)
- Import that apostle creature to Models/
- Put a pit below the arena that if collided with a player, will kill (YOU DIED) sys.exit

Optional:
- Pvp mode
- Yell move
- Make a youtube video "Can you beat Revenge on Castle Morde by Only Shouting?"
- Menu cutscene (via .mp4 player) Find a berserk compilation montage to edit then import here :)
- Dodge move
- Tutorial level via menu
- Implement sound (Menu music, Game: Background noise, music, battle music, attack sounds and footsteps (self.accept for every keyb input-playsound))
- Take Tutorial option in menu
- Speed consumable that (if): collided with (queue 201) will reduce FRICTION variable for a limited time or permanently. Give this aibehavioursWander
- On (def beginnewround): , maybe add a .png of people cheering as a vignette at setPos(near the camera)
- Hostile pursuer(self.player) who, if collided with (queue 101) will reduce the player health
- Finish :/ jk loser 

Thoughts:
- Let flee(self.player) phase through platforms but not arena walls. BC flee'er is not as fast as players and there's usually two 
- Make sure evaders and AI cannot use Z to phase through the walls. Add collisions or disable all .z movement
- Might want to change enemy1 collisionBox to enemy1 collisionSphere
