Welcome TO my To-Do list! 

Necessary: 
- Visit Calgary :)))
- Make animations: Idle, attack, walk https://github.com/fireclawthefox/panda3d-tutorial/blob/master/Panda3D%20Tutorial.pdf
- Gui and menu (Menu.py and healthbars)
- Enemy Ai (Pathfinding, attacks)
- Death (Ez doing it rn, upon death, sys.exit and launch the main menu; but not before the signature "YOU DIED" for 4 seconds)
- Create an arena (Castlevenia)
- Attack col: use event system (self.accept) https://docs.panda3d.org/1.10/python/programming/collision-detection/collision-handlers
- Put a pit below the arena that if collided with a player, will kill (YOU DIED) sys.exit
- KeyMap[Tab] for opening menu (WILL NOT PAUSE GAME) make sure to have base.disableMouse as default and if KeyMap[Tab] enable mouse

Optional:
- Pvp mode
- Yell move
- Make a youtube video "Can you beat Revenge on Castle Morde by Only Shouting?"
- Menu cutscene (via .mp4 player) Find a berserk compilation montage to edit then import here :)
- Dodge move
- Implement sound (Menu music, Game: Background noise, music, battle music, attack sounds and footsteps (self.accept for every keyb input-playsound))
- Take Tutorial option in menu
- Speed consumable that (if): collided with (queue 201) will reduce FRICTION variable for a limited time or permanently. Give this aibehavioursWander
- On (def beginnewround): , maybe add a .png of people cheering as a vignette at setPos(near the camera)
- Hostile pursuer(self.player) who, if collided with (queue 101) will reduce the player health
- Finish :/ jk loser 

Thoughts:
- Let flee(self.player) phase through platforms but not arena walls. BC flee'er is not as fast as players and there's usually two
